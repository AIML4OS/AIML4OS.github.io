    "text": "WP6 is advancing towards creating a comprehensive knowledge repository and an extensive range of training materials. These resources aim to support stakeholders across various sectors, providing valuable educational content and standardized materials for the application of AI/ML techniques in different fields. The initial task involves researching topics to include in the knowledge repository: general ML and AI topics, task-driven use cases, best practices, and specialized techniques related to data handling and big data management. Additionally, SSPCloud will host various “cards” for each topic, making the information easily accessible. The second task is dedicated to compiling an inventory of ready-to-use training materials. Early results show a collection including about 20 files (slides, PDFs, and scripts), 11 online courses hosted by NSIs, and 13 courses and books hosted by other institutions. These materials primarily focus on introducing data science and ML concepts, Python and R programming, and best practices for ML workflows.\nLooking ahead, other tasks involves listing additional training materials, gradual transfer of data to the repository and training sessions."

The project is structured into 3 key tasks: a literature review and project overview, methodological investigations and implementation, and the final dissemination of the results. The literature review provides the foundation for future developments. To manage the various points of view of the methodological investigations in text classification, it was chosen to organize the team into 5 different dedicated clusters:\n\nCluster 1, tackling data gaps by generating synthetic training material in multiple languages\nCluster 2, enhancing natural language understanding using RAG LLM and Transformer models\nCluster 3, incorporating hierarchical structures into classification models\nCluster 4, ensuring robust deployment and maintenance of classification models through quality assurance measures\nCluster 5, adapting to evolving classification system revisions,particularly in the NACE framework\n\nKey deliverables include a working classification codebase in Python and/or R, as well as a comprehensive report documenting methodologies and recommendations."
