    "text": "AI and Machine Learning for Official Statistics (AIML4OS) is major project aimed at supporting National Statistics Institutes in the use of AI and Machine Learning for the production of official statistics. The project, which includes 15 countries across Europe, will run for four years from April 2024 to March 2028. The overarching goal of the project is to provide a comprehensive set of resources that can be used by staff across the European Statistical System (ESS) to implement AI and machine learning in their organisations. These resources will include guidelines, implementation frameworks, working use cases, sample code and information on technical resources.\nThe project is developed through 13 Work Packages (WPs), six of these are ‘Supporting Workpackages’, which have operational functions and deliver cross-cutting goals for the project. The remaining seven are ‘Use Case Workpackages’ which explore specific themes within AI/ML that are believed will offer huge opportunities for statistical production in the coming years.\n\n\n\nMembers of the AIML4OS consortium at the project launch in Wiesbaden, April 2024\n\n\n\nCountries involved in AIML4OS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbreviation\nOrganisation\nCountry\n\n\n\n\nCSO\nCentral Statistics Office\nIreland\n\n\nDST\nDanmarks Statistik\nDenmark\n\n\nINSEE\nInstitut National De La Statistique Et Des Etudes Economiques\nFrance\n\n\nINE (PT)\nInstituto Nacional de Estatística (Portugal)\nPortugal\n\n\nCBS\nCentraal Bureau voor de Statistiek\nNetherlands\n\n\nSTATEC\nInstitut National de laSstatistique et des Études Économiques\nLuxembourg\n\n\nGUS\nGlowny Urzad Statystyczny\nPoland\n\n\nDESTATIS\nStatistisches Bundesamt\nGermany\n\n\nSCB\nStatistiska Centralbyran\nSweden\n\n\nSURS\nStatisticni urad Republike Slovenije\nSlovenia\n\n\nSSB\nStatistisk Sentralbyraa\nNorway\n\n\nISTAT\nIstituto Nazionale di Statistica\nItaly\n\n\nSTAT\nBundesanstalt Statistik Oesterreich\nAustria\n\n\nINE (ES)\nInstituto Nacional de Estadística\nSpain\n\n\nCYSTAT\nStatistical Service of Cyprus\nCyprus"

These resources aim to support stakeholders across various sectors, providing valuable educational content and standardized materials for the application of AI/ML techniques in different fields. The initial task involves researching topics to include in the knowledge repository: general ML and AI topics, task-driven use cases, best practices, and specialized techniques related to data handling and big data management. Additionally, SSPCloud will host various “cards” for each topic, making the information easily accessible. The second task is dedicated to compiling an inventory of ready-to-use training materials. Early results show a collection including about 20 files (slides, PDFs, and scripts), 11 online courses hosted by NSIs, and 13 courses and books hosted by other institutions. These materials primarily focus on introducing data science and ML concepts, Python and R programming, and best practices for ML workflows.\nLooking ahead, other tasks involves listing additional training materials, gradual transfer of data to the repository and training sessions."
