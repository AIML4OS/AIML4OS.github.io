The overarching goal of the project is to provide a comprehensive set of resources that can be used by staff across the European Statistical System (ESS) to implement AI and machine learning in their organisations. These resources will include guidelines, implementation frameworks, working use cases, sample code and information on technical resources.\nThe project is developed through 13 Work Packages (WPs), six of these are ‘Supporting Workpackages’, which have operational functions and deliver cross-cutting goals for the project. The remaining seven are ‘Use Case Workpackages’ which explore specific themes within AI/ML that are believed will offer huge opportunities for statistical production in the coming years.\n\n\n\nMembers of the AIML4OS consortium at the project launch in Wiesbaden, April 2024"
